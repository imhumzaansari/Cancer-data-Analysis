# Project Vision - EDA on Cancer Dataset

This project harnesses the power of advanced analytics and global health data to uncover **actionable insights** into cancer care, outcomes, and disparities.

Using a robust dataset of **50,000 cancer patient records** collected from multiple countries between **2015 and 2024**, we aim to bridge the gap between raw data and life-saving decisions.

## What the Data Covers

Our dataset provides a **360-degree view** of cancer patient profiles, including:

- **Demographics**  
  Age, gender, country, year of diagnosis

- **Genetic & Lifestyle Risks**  
  Genetic predisposition, smoking, alcohol use, obesity

- **Environmental Exposure**  
  Air pollution

- **Clinical & Economic Variables**  
  Cancer type, stage at diagnosis, treatment cost

- **Patient Outcomes**  
  Survival years, severity scores

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identify key trends, hidden patterns, and meaningful relationships
- Visualize disparities in diagnosis, lifestyle factors, treatment patterns, and outcomes
- Highlight variations across **countries**, **age groups**, and **cancer stages**

### 2. Inferential & Predictive Analytics

Using statistical methods, we will explore and answer critical healthcare questions:

- Relationship between risk factors and **cancer severity**
- Proportion of **early-stage** diagnoses by cancer type
- Key predictors of cancer severity **by cancer type**
- Economic burden of cancer treatment across different **demographics** and **countries**
- Is higher treatment cost associated with **longer survival**?
- Do higher cancer stages lead to greater treatment costs and **reduced survival** years?
- Does **genetic risk** amplify the negative effects of smoking on cancer severity and survival outcomes?

### 3. Insight Extraction and Documentation

- Draw clear, **evidence-backed inferences** for each major analysis
- Systematically document all findings for future **clinical**, **academic**, and **operational** use
- Link each insight to **real-world implications** — to guide decision-making and policy formulation
